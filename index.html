			<strong> Elevator Speech</strong> <br>
			<p>
				Meal exchanging between eating clubs at Princeton University is one of the most error prone systems at Princeton. In the current system, people have to fill out blue slips at each meal of a meal exhchange. These slips easily get are time consuming for users to fill out, officers to match and check, and often get lost, so people get unfairly charged. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, a team of fed up Princeton students have decided to take it upon themselves to rid the world of this terrible system and MAKE MEAL EXCHANGING GREAT AGAIN! “eXchange” is an app designed to completely revolutionize the eating club meal exchange process. It will give club members the ability to schedule and plan out meal exchanges with one another while giving the meal checkers of club the convenience of a completely electronic system. We hope that it will make meal exchanging a more social, convenient and public activity for students.
